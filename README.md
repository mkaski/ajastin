# Ajast.in
_(Ajastin, Finnish for "timer")_
AngularJS timer - http://ajast.in/v2/

Getting to know AngularJS project. A timer web app. Because there's always something cooking while I'm working on the browser.
It's a bit laggy and buggy. Probably won't work on mobile because of screen going to sleep. Warning: loud noises!

To install: (generate dist -folder)

```
npm install
bower install
grunt (or grunt --force)
```
